# Flutter Bottom Navigation Bar

Bottom navigation bars allow movement between primary destinations in an app. Each destination is represented by an icon and an optional text label. When a bottom navigation icon is tapped, the user is taken to the top-level navigation destination associated with that icon.  

### How to use

I added the ```curved_navigation_bar: ^0.3.1``` in the pubspec.yaml
